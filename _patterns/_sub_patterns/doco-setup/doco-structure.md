# Documentation Structure

This project uses **four distinct documentation surfaces**. Each has a different audience, lifespan,
and update cadence. Putting content in the wrong place is a slow-burning cost: the wrong people read
it (or miss it), it goes stale, or it crowds out what the surface is actually for.

This document explains what belongs where, when to update each, and the conventions that keep them
coherent.

## The four surfaces

### 1. `/README.md` — for humans landing on the repo

**Audience.** Someone who just clicked through to the repository. A prospective user, a curious
passer-by, a future contributor. No prior context.

**Purpose.** Answer the first-ninety-seconds questions: What is this? Is it for me? What's its status
(usable / in development / abandoned)? How do I install or try it? Where do I learn more?

**Tone.** Big-picture, plain language, skim-friendly. One browser tab, no scrolling fatigue.

**Does NOT belong here.** Architecture detail (→ `docs/`), implementation specifics, working notes,
LLM agent instructions (→ `CLAUDE.md`).

**Cadence.** Stable. Edit when something *user-facing* changes (status, positioning, install steps).

### 2. `/CLAUDE.md` — the always-loaded operating rules for LLM agents

**Audience.** Claude (and other LLM agents) picking up a task here, with no memory of prior sessions.

**Mechanics that define it.** `CLAUDE.md` is loaded **in full, every session**, and read as
instructions to obey. Every token is paid on every session — so it must stay **small and
high-leverage**; bloat dilutes the signal and gets load-bearing rules missed.

**Purpose.** The small set of **always-on, imperative** rules + orientation:
- what the project is, in one paragraph;
- where to read first / the repo's layout;
- load-bearing **principles** that constrain *every* task;
- the **out-of-scope** list, so the agent never proposes deliberately-excluded things;
- broad project-specific conventions;
- **pointers** (not duplicated content) to `MEMORY` and `docs/` — including a **required-reading line
  for [`docs/INDEX.md`](#4-docs--the-technical--knowledge-wiki)**. Unlike `MEMORY.md`, the docs index is
  **not** auto-injected each session, so the always-loaded `CLAUDE.md` must explicitly tell the agent to
  read it (then load the relevant doc on demand — the same index-then-load pattern as `MEMORY`).

**Does NOT belong here.** Situational knowledge that isn't relevant every session (→ `MEMORY`),
generic language/framework advice, deep detail (→ `docs/`), user-facing framing (→ `README`).

**Cadence.** Stable. A rule lands here when it must bind **every** session — often by *graduating up*
from `MEMORY` (see the split below). Don't let it grow into a wiki.

### 3. `MEMORY.md` (+ `.claude/memory/`) — the agent's accumulated durable knowledge

**Audience.** Claude, across sessions. The **index** (`MEMORY.md`, one line per memory) is loaded
every session; the **topic files** are pulled in **on demand** when a task touches them.

**Mechanics that define it.** Because only the index is always-loaded and the detail is lazy-loaded,
`MEMORY` can hold a **large, growing** body of knowledge cheaply — the situational counterpart to
CLAUDE.md's always-on rules.

**Purpose.** Durable, **declarative** decisions / agreements / facts — *"principles, not state":*
- durable decisions and the **why** behind them;
- user preferences and agreements;
- component- or area-specific facts you should **recall when working there**.

**Does NOT belong here.** Universal rules that bind *every* session (→ `CLAUDE.md`); **ephemeral or
repo-derivable state** — paths, "what's built", commit SHAs (git/code already holds it; it goes stale
on creation); deep architectural rationale (→ `docs/`).

**Cadence.** Living. Claude writes to it as decisions accrue — one focused topic file per memory, a
one-line entry in `MEMORY.md` so it's discoverable.

### 4. `docs/` — the technical / knowledge wiki

**Audience.** Anyone working on the project's architecture, design, or substance — humans and agents
alike.

**Purpose.** The full record. Architecture, decisions, rationale, plans, post-mortems, glossaries —
the place where deep *why* lives. (For a non-software project, the same surface holds the project's
substantive knowledge base; the role is identical even if the content isn't code.)

**Structure.**
- **`INDEX.md`** — entry point: every document with a one-line description, organised by category. It
  is **required reading**, surfaced by a pointer in the always-loaded `CLAUDE.md` (the index is not
  auto-loaded; the pointer is what makes it reliably read). An un-indexed document is invisible.
- **Content documents** — one focused topic per file, kebab-case (`schema-design.md`).

**One docs surface, at the top level only.** In a multi-repo (umbrella) project, `docs/` lives **only at
the umbrella** — a single shared documentation surface for the umbrella *and* every sub-repo. Sub-repos
hold **no** `docs/` of their own (you always launch from the umbrella, so one surface serves all). In a
single-repo project, `docs/` is at that repo's root. Either way there is exactly one `docs/`, at the top.

**Exception — stand-alone-reusable sub-repos may self-document.** (Umbrella/multi-repo projects.) A
sub-repo whose code could reasonably be used **outside this project** — e.g. a library a third party
might install into an unrelated project — **may** (not must) carry its own internal `docs/` so the repo
is understandable in isolation by someone who never sees the top-level repo. The criterion is
**stand-alone reusability**: a general-purpose library that stands on its own qualifies; a sub-repo that
makes sense *only* within this project does not, so its documentation lives at the top-level docs
surface. A self-documenting sub-repo follows the same conventions as the top-level `docs/` (an
`INDEX.md` entry point, one kebab-case topic per file), and the top-level `INDEX.md` should list it so
it stays discoverable.

**A self-documenting sub-repo carries a _reduced_ set, not the full suite.** Its internal docs are only
what's needed to understand and use the repo in isolation: a `README` (for whoever lands on it),
repo-specific agent context (`CLAUDE.md`), and content `docs/` (an `INDEX.md` plus kebab-case topic
files describing how the code works). It does **not** restate the project's documentation conventions —
those live once, at the top level — and it has **no memory surface of its own**; durable agent memory
is a project-level concern held at the top level. The sub-repo *follows* the top-level conventions; it
never carries a copy of them.

**Does NOT belong here.** Agent instructions (`CLAUDE.md`), user-facing framing (`README.md`),
throwaway scratch notes (if it isn't worth indexing, it isn't worth keeping).

**Cadence.** Active — documents are added/updated as topics arise; history is preserved (supersede,
don't delete).

## The `CLAUDE.md` ⇄ `MEMORY` split (the LLM-facing division)

Both are for the agent, so the boundary matters. Two axes settle it:

- **Always-on vs situational.** `CLAUDE.md` is loaded in full *every* session → only universal,
  every-task content earns a place (keep it small). `MEMORY` is indexed-now / detail-on-demand →
  the larger body of *sometimes-relevant* durable knowledge.
- **Imperative vs declarative.** `CLAUDE.md` = rules you *apply* ("do X, never Y, read Z first").
  `MEMORY` = knowledge you *recall* ("we chose X because Y; the user prefers Z").

**The graduation flow:** a decision is made in conversation → if durable, it's recorded in `MEMORY`
→ **if it must bind every session, it graduates up into `CLAUDE.md`.** If `CLAUDE.md` accumulates
situational detail, that **demotes down into `MEMORY`.** `CLAUDE.md` trends small-and-universal;
`MEMORY` accumulates-and-specialises.

## Quick decision guide

| Question | ⇒ goes in |
|---|---|
| Will a non-developer visitor want to see this? | `README.md` |
| Is it a rule/constraint that must steer **every** agent session? | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Is it a durable decision/agreement/fact to **recall when working on a specific thing**? | `MEMORY` (topic file + index line) |
| Is it architectural detail, decision rationale, or a plan? | `docs/` (and indexed in `INDEX.md`) |
| Is it ephemeral or derivable from the repo (paths, "what's built")? | Don't write it — git/code has it |
| Useful for the *current task only*? | Don't write it — keep it in the conversation |

If content seems to belong in two places, prefer the more durable/detailed surface (`docs/` or
`MEMORY`) and **link** to it from the always-on ones (`README`, `CLAUDE.md`), which stay short.

## Conventions for `docs/` documents

- **Filename:** kebab-case, descriptive, stable (`schema-design.md`, not `notes-2026-04.md`).
- **First line:** an `# H1 Title` matching the filename.
- **Second block:** a one-paragraph summary — what shows in a preview pane and gets quoted in `INDEX.md`.
- **Cross-references:** relative links to other docs (`[schema design](schema-design.md)`); leading
  slash to root files (`[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)`).
- **Third-party code references:** cite a dependency's source as an inline-code path relative to that
  package's own root (e.g. `` `package/module/file` ``, `` `ClassName.method()` ``) — never as a working
  link into a local install directory (a virtualenv, `node_modules`, vendor folder, or other
  machine-specific path). The dependency's real home is upstream, not this repo; a link into a local
  install breaks across machines and operating systems. Link upstream (a permalink to the project's
  repository) only if you can pin a stable revision.
- **Index it.** Add a one-line entry to `INDEX.md`. An un-indexed document is invisible.
- **Capture the *why*.** A doc that says *what* without *why* is obsoleted by the first strong
  counter-argument. The *why* is what makes it durable.
- **Don't delete; supersede.** Leave a superseded doc in place with a note linking forward.

## Why four surfaces and not one

A single `README` is too long for visitors or too shallow for contributors. `CLAUDE.md` alone either
pulls in agent-irrelevant marketing or omits depth. `MEMORY` exists because an agent needs durable
recall that *accumulates* without bloating the always-loaded rules. `docs/` without an entry point is
invisible. Four surfaces, each focused on one audience and one cadence, linking where helpful: the
cost is a little discipline about what goes where; the benefit is each surface stays useful for the
long haul.
